# Color Extract Tool

This tool is based on [quantize.js](https://gist.github.com/nrabinowitz/1104622) that will extract color information from photo uploaded and list the top 5 colors
for design. This may work like [Vibrant.js](http://jariz.github.io/vibrant.js/) while I just want to realize a tool by
myself.

### Basic Tech Design
This tool should be designed as single page web application and just use html/css/js file to implement.

### How to use
Easily, just open the html file in your Chrome (well, I highly recommend Chrome other than Firefox, Safari, etc.) browser and then choose an image file to upload!
Be noted that we won't upload any file, we just use the widget to pass the file to js for further processing.

### Need Improvement
* support input x for top x colors
* refactor code
* rewrite the basic functions that more unified
